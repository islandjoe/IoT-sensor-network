# IoT Sensor Network

This is a proof-of-concept implementation that I made in preparation for my bachelor's thesis. My thesis adviser loaned me a Raspberry Pi, a touch-screen, a camera module, and a ThingSee One (an IoT developer device), with the instruction to come up with a system that is essentially a remote sensor network.
